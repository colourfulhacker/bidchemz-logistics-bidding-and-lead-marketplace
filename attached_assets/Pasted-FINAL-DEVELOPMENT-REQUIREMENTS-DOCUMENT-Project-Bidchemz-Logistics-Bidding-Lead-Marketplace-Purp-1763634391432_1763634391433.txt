FINAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT

Project: Bidchemz Logistics Bidding & Lead Marketplace
Purpose: Provide buyers/sellers (chemical traders) an “InDrive-style” logistics quotation system while generating revenue through partner lead sales.

1. CORE BUSINESS MODEL
1.1 Concept Summary

Your platform acts like InDrive but for chemical logistics:

A chemical trader (buyer or seller) submits a freight requirement from the marketplace.

The logistics portal distributes that request to multiple logistics partners.

Each partner submits their own quote (just like drivers sending different prices).

The trader sees multiple offers and selects the most suitable option.

The selected logistics partner is charged a lead fee (credit-based or pay-per-lead).

Bidchemz earns revenue from selling qualified logistics leads.

1.2 Objectives

Help chemical traders easily get logistics support.

Provide logistics partners with high-quality leads (DG cargo, ISO tanks, bulk, etc.).

Build a scalable API-driven logistics engine that integrates tightly with the chemical marketplace.

Monetize logistics operations through a transparent lead marketplace.

2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The system has three major components:

Chemical Marketplace (Existing)

Traders create product transactions.

Logistics Bidding & Lead System (New)

Forms, quote engine, partner routing, lead monetization.

Logistics Partner Interface (Portal + APIs)

Partner capabilities, quoting, lead wallet, payments.

Integration Model:
Marketplace → Logistics Engine → Partner Quotes → Trader Selection → Lead Charge

3. USER ROLES

Trader (Buyer/Seller) – initiates logistics request.

Logistics Partner – receives freight leads and sends quotes.

Admin – manages pricing, partner tiers, capabilities, credits.

Marketplace System – calls APIs to create logistics requests.

4. FREIGHT REQUEST FORM (MASTER FORM)

The Freight Quote Request Form must have all 9 sections as previously defined.

Mandatory Minimum Inputs (from your summary):

Pickup Location (exact)

Delivery Location (exact)

Cargo Name (CAS No basis)

Quantity (Value + Unit: MT/KG/Litres)

Packaging type (bags, drums, tanker, etc.)

Hazardous: Yes/No

Cargo Ready Date

Full Form Includes:

(Already defined in prior document – fully included for development)

Shipment Info

Pickup Location

Delivery Location

Handling Requirements

Vehicle Requirements

Insurance & Compliance

Billing & Payment

Additional Notes

Submit button → triggers matching engine

No reduction.
No changes.
This is the authoritative form structure.

5. LOGISTICS BIDDING WORKFLOW (InDrive-Style)

The workflow must follow the reverse-bidding model:

Step 1: Trader submits freight request

Created via:

Marketplace API call

Stand-alone portal

Step 2: System validates all mandatory fields

Invalid requests are rejected at API level.

Step 3: Matching Engine selects eligible partners

Based on:

Cargo type, hazardous class

Location coverage

Service capability (bulk, ISO tank, reefer, etc.)

Packaging

Vehicle requirements

Palletisation / handling

Temperature control

Subscription tier (premium > standard > free)

Lead credit availability

Step 4: Request is sent to matched partners

Partners get:

Real-time notification (email, SMS, WhatsApp, portal notification)

Required cargo details (sanitized of pricing)

Timer to submit quote (e.g., 30–60 min)

Step 5: Partners submit quotes

Partner inputs:

Price

Expected transit time

Validity

Value-added services (e.g., real-time GPS, no transshipment)

Pickup availability

Step 6: Trader receives list of offers

Displayed in ascending/descending order based on:

Price

Transit speed

Partner rating

Previous performance

Trader can choose the offer that best fits their budget, exactly like selecting a driver in InDrive.

Step 7: Trader selects a quote

Selection triggers:

Booking confirmation

Lead being assigned to the selected partner

Lead fee charged to partner wallet

Step 8: Shipment execution

Partner manages:

Vehicle assignment

Status updates (pickup → in transit → delivered)

6. LEAD MONETIZATION ENGINE

This is the revenue-generating backbone.

6.1 Lead Types

Exclusive Lead (Premium partners)

Goes to one partner only

Highest pricing

Shared Leads (Standard/Free partners)

Goes to multiple partners

Lower pricing

6.2 Lead Pricing Model

Lead price can depend on:

Cargo nature (DG, corrosive, flammable)

Quantity & weight

Origin–destination distance

Vehicle type

Urgency

Subscription tier

State-wise pricing

6.3 Lead Wallet

Partners have:

Lead credits

Auto-deduction on lead assignment

Ability to buy credits/packages

Recharge notifications

GST-compliant invoicing

6.4 Lead Transactions

Every lead must generate:

lead_id

partner_id

lead_cost

credits_deducted

timestamp

invoice_id (if paid)

7. LOGISTICS PARTNER CAPABILITIES (REQUIRED FIELDS)

Exactly as earlier defined:

Service types

DG classes

Product categories

Geographic coverage

Fleet types

Storage capabilities (if any)

Partner must regularly update capabilities.

8. PARTNER QUOTE ENGINE (OFFER SUBMISSION)

Partners must be able to:

View active freight requests

Submit price quotation

Edit/update before expiry

Withdraw quote

View lead charge preview

Accept booking once trader selects them

9. MARKETPLACE API INTEGRATION (MANDATORY)

Marketplace must integrate at API Level.

Required endpoints:

POST /api/v1/quotes

GET /api/v1/quotes/{id}

GET /api/v1/quotes/{id}/offers

POST /api/v1/quotes/{id}/select

Document upload endpoints

Shipment tracking endpoints

Authentication:

OAuth2 / API Key

All marketplace workflows MUST use API only — never internal DB access.

10. WEBHOOK SYSTEM

Webhooks must notify marketplace about:

quote.requested

quote.offers.available

quote.offer.selected

shipment.booked

shipment.status.updated

lead.assigned

lead.payment.failed (if credit insufficient)

11. DATABASE MODELS

Must include:

Users (trader, partner, admin)

Quotes

Offers

Shipments

Documents (MSDS/SDS)

Partner Capabilities

Lead Wallet & Transactions

Partner Pricing Tiers

Audit Logs

Webhook Logs

12. ADMIN PANEL REQUIREMENTS

Admin must manage:

Lead pricing rules

Partner capability validation

Subscription tiers

Lead credits

Payments & invoices

Partner onboarding (KYC, DG certifications)

Complaint handling

Marketplace API clients

System configuration

13. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Performance

<300ms average API response for GET requests

<1000ms for POST with validations

Security

Full encryption for documents

Strict RBAC

HMAC signed webhooks

Scalability

Must handle 100,000+ monthly quote requests

Horizontal scaling of matching engine

Uptime

99.9% API availability target
